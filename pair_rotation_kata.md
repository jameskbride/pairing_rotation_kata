# Pair Rotation Kata

This kata simulates pair switching on a team of eight developers who practice pair-programming. Each pair works on a story that takes one, two, or three days to complete.  This team has normed on pair switching on Mondays and Wednesdays in order to keep the pairing fresh and spread knowledge optimally.  They've also decided that when switching pairs one person must "anchor" a given story in order to maintain the context of the story and insure it is completed as quickly as possible. There is a problem however, in that there are two tech leads on this team.  These tech leads get pulled into meetings frequently, which causes friction for the developers that they pair with. In order to keep the pairing moving smoothly the team has come up with some norms, listed below:

### Rules

1. One person from each pair must "anchor" the story they're working on at each switch.
2. No pair should work together twice in one week when pair switching unless this breaks Rule 1.
3. No developer should pair consecutively with a tech lead when pair switching unless this breaks Rule 1 or 2.
4. Tech leads should not pair together unless this breaks Rule 1, 2, or 3.
5. A pair may request a pair switch when they complete a story unless this breaks Rule 1, 2, or 3.
